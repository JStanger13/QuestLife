# QuestLife

<h2>A ToDo List app that makes everyday tasks a quest!</h2>

<h3>Make mundane tasks fun by defeating bosses while you work! Each item on your list is created as a "Quest". Smaller Side Quests can be added to each Quest.</h3>

<p>The app pulls data from GuideBox, an API that collects data from various tv networks and streaming services. Calls are made using Retrofit. All the shows are displayed in a grid layout. The available networks are scrollable using a horizontal Recycler View. </p>


<p>
There is a detail activity that shows all shows from a network, and another detail activity that displays each episode of that series.

Users can also search by show title in the Search Activity.
